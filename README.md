# Turing_ellipse
This repository contains all computational codes and models associated with the paper "Turing bifurcations on elliptical domains: A deviation from rectangular and circular limits", authored by Thomas E. Woolley. While Turing patterns have been well-characterised on simple geometries such as lines, rectangles, and circles, elliptical domains remain underexplored—particularly in terms of how bifurcation properties vary with the ellipse’s shape. We investigate how the critical domain size required for a Turing bifurcation changes as an ellipse transitions from a circle to an elongated shape and, in the limit, to a one-dimensional domain. Our findings challenge the assumption that bifurcation behaviour on ellipses interpolates smoothly between circular and linear geometries.

### Key Observations

- As the ellipse's aspect ratio approaches one, the bifurcation behaviour resembles that of a circular domain.
- In the limit of a thin ellipse, the system **does not** converge to one-dimensional behaviour—unlike in the case of rectangular domains.
- Although the ellipse's geometry can interpolate between the flat plane and the circle, the Turing bifurcation structure is completely different.
- This divergence is due to the intrinsic coupling between radial and angular modes in the elliptical geometry.
